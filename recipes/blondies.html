  <h1>Blondies</h1>

  <p class="description">Blondies are a type of dessert bar that is similar to brownies but with a different flavor. They are made with brown sugar instead of cocoa and are often baked in a pan, and then cut into squares or rectangles. Other ingredients such as walnuts or chips can be added to the mixture. Blondies are soft and chewy. The name 'blondies' comes from their light color, which contrasts with the dark color of traditional brownies.</p>

    <li>In a large bowl, cream together 3/4 cup of butter, brown sugar and white sugar until light and fluffy.

Press the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs. Cool completely before frosting.</li>
    <li>To make the frosting, mix the remaining 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup peanut butter together in a medium bowl. Mix in the confectioners sugar until smooth, then gradually stir in milk until a spreadable consistency is reached. Cut, serve and enjoy!</li>
